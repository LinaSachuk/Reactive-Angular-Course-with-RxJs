Build Angular 13 Applications in Reactive style with plain RxJs - Patterns,Anti-Patterns, Lightweight State Management

## This Course in a Nutshell

This course is a catalog of commonly used design patterns (and some anti-patterns) that every Angular developer should know. The goal of the course is to teach you how to comfortably design and develop applications in Angular in Reactive style using just plain RxJs, and nothing more.

This course comes with a running Github repository with the the finished code, as well as starting points for different sections of the course in case that you want to code along, which we recommend as its the best way to learn.

This course answers the common question: how far can we go in Angular while using only plain RxJs and nothing more, without introducing any state management library?

It turns out that the simple set of techniques taught in this course are very well suited for a wide range of applications, especially in-house built enterprise applications.

In this course, you will learn exactly how to use RxJs to design and develop both the service and the view layers of your application, and you will understand both the advantages and the pitfalls of the reactive approach.

Particularly when it comes to state management, it turns out that we can already go very far by leveraging only plain Angular and RxJs techniques, without using an additional state management library like for example NgRx.

These simplified state management techniques are adequate and sufficient for a large range of applications, and we believe that you should consider them first before thinking of adopting a full-blown state management solution.

How far can you go with these techniques? That's what you will find out in this course.
